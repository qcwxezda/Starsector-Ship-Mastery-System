It's almost entirely barren, little more than a featureless space rock, with hardly anything to observe outside the stray indent from a smaller rock -- a sure indicator that the barrier, at least on a geological level, was a recent addition.

You're just about to delegate the task of combing through what little there is to inspect to a dedicated salvage team when you notice a near-invisible blip on your preliminary scan chart alerting you to the presence of a possibly artificial formation. A second, higher resolution scan of the surrounding region reveals a small facility sequestered at the bottom of a particularly deep valley. The thought of a small research colony hiding away amidst the most remote recesses of the sector briefly crosses your mind, but that's preposterous. Colonizing a planet this deep in abyssal hyperspace would be virtually impossible. You instruct your sensors officer to run a cocktail of tests on the planet's surface to detect signs of organic activity. The conclusion: the probability of encountering any living biological life-forms, adjusted for the clearly man-made structures on and around the planet, nonetheless remains at or below the computed error margin of a thousandth of a percent.

""What are your orders, chief?"" An impatient voice rings out on comms.

Whatever you're about to find down there could be a monumental discovery. And you couldn't in good conscience risk a technologically-inexperienced team of salvors, known for destroying as much high-tech salvage as they haul back, potentially breaking things. You're determined to personally oversee at least this initial excursion.

It's equally as dark inside, and just as abandoned as the calculations predicted. Curiously, there aren't even any light fixtures or emplacements capable of holding light fixtures. As you wander about, you notice a few other peculiarities. Scattered throughout are desks, cabinets, and counter-tops laden with assorted but clearly incongruous equipment, among them ship repair tools married to small-arms weapons, and antimatter fuel in non-Domain-standard containers haphazardly laid about among piles of long-expired computer chips. In another section, you find what appears to be a pitcher of inert liquid resting atop some sort of dining table, but there's no evidence that any food, perishable or otherwise, ever made its way here.
