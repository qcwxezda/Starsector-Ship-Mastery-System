0.10.0
-----------

Weakly save compatible with previous version, but mastery level progression and mastery effect generation have been changed,
 so if you update, your mastery tables will be rearranged and effects may not be the same as before.

The standard mastery progression has been reworked a bit. In summary: reduced possible S-mods at max mastery from 4 to 3,
removed the DP penalty from the 3rd (previously 4th) S-mod slot. Details:
- S-mod capacity masteries removed from levels 4 and 6 and replaced with randomized masteries.
- S-mod capacity mastery added to level 5.
- DP-penalizing S-mod capacity mastery removed from level 8, replaced with standard S-mod capacity mastery.
- Level 1 mastery effect strength multiplier 0.6 -> 1, level 2-6 masteries effect strength multiplier 0.8 -> 1.

Added the ability to reroll mastery effects upon reaching max mastery level.
- Costs 20 MP and 1 SP.
- Affects all randomized effects (by default, this is now the effects at levels 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7).
- Seeded for each ship hull, so it can't be save-scummed, e.g. rerolling a ship hull's masteries for the kth time will
  always yield the same result.

Added the ability to enhance mastery bonuses upon reaching max mastery level.
- Costs 20 MP (+5 MP for each previous enhance) and 1 SP.
- Increases mastery strength by 8%, can be done a maximum of 5 times.

Other changes:
- Mastery strength bonuses have been changed: Best of the Best 20% -> 30%, mastery scaling buff 40% -> 30%.
- Maximum mastery strength bonus 60% -> 100% with addition of enhancing. Numerous effects have had their base strength
  reduced slightly to compensate.
- Default presets are now assigned according to the ship spec's hints, tags, and/or built-in mods.
  This should help compatibility with modded civilian ships, remnant ships, etc.
   - logistic_cargo checks for FREIGHTER hint, logistic_crew checks for LINER hint, logistic_fuel checks for TANKER hint.
   - automated ships check for automated built-in hullmod, derelict drones check for derelict tag.
   - phase ships check for phasefield built-in hullmod.
   - if a single ship hull satisfies multiple conditions, the priority order is hints -> tags -> built-in mods.
- Automated and phase ships now get an extra S-mod slot in level 8A in addition to their previous bonuses.
- Single actions that grant less than 600 XP no longer give MP to civilian ships.
- Increased combat ship MP gain by ~15%.
- Reduced auto-pursuit MP gain by ~30%, and fixed a bug that caused more auto-pursuit MP gain than intended.
- Reduced base credits cost for building in S-mods by 25%.
- Increased mastery leveling costs across the board by 1, except levels beyond 8 which now cost a flat 15 MP.
- Knowledge constructs now give 10 MP, up from 5.
- Knowledge constructs now have two drop tables, one table is random as before and the other strongly prefers ships
  already in the player's fleet. Most drop sources use the non-random table.
- Knowledge constructs no longer generate for ships with the STATION hint.
- Fixed an issue with mastery generation that could cause different masteries to be generated with the same seed
  if a previous set of effects had already been stored into memory.
- Resolved possible NPE during custom collision check.
- Fixed an issue where non-modules could sometimes be treated as modules, causing some mastery effects to not work properly.
