sms_remote_beacon,CUSTOM,"This seemingly unremarkable rock is encapsulated by an impenetrable barrier. Whoever would go through the trouble to shield a planet so removed from the confines of the sector must have stashed within it infinite wealth, power, or some combination of the two. At least, that's what common folklore would suggest."
sms_remote_beacon_no_shield,CUSTOM,This seemingly unremarkable rock was once enveloped by an impenetrable barrier.
sms_concealed_probe,CUSTOM,"An autonomous probe of impressive scale equipped with a sensor cloak. This particular probe, while not currently functional, appears to have been calibrated to detect pockets of unusually high environmental flux that would indicate the presence of a venting, overloaded, or destroyed spacefaring vessel.",,,,
sms_concealed_station,CUSTOM,"A seemingly abandoned station, located far away from civilized space and outfitted with a device that masks its sensor signal, albeit with limited effectiveness. Whoever built this station clearly wanted to keep it safe from prying pirates, scavengers, and adventurers alike. A closer inspection is required.",,,,
sms_station_nucleus,CUSTOM,"A massive siphon intercepting a pair of binary stars, deformed by cycles of bidirectional tension.",,,,
sms_emitter_array,CUSTOM,One of a set of six orbital installations found surrounding some unassuming rock beyond the farthest reaches of the sector. Possibly plays a part in erecting the planetary-scale shield protecting said rock.,,,,
sms_alpha_k_core,RESOURCE,"A modified alpha core, fed with vast quantities of battle simulation data. Your engineers joke that it's a miracle the core hasn't formed a singularity and collapsed upon itself.

Despite originating from an alpha core, its components have been stripped to such a degree that it lacks much of its original capability to reason intelligently with immense amounts of data. Careful interplay between the Amorphous Core and its fleet's commander is an absolute requirement for fielding it effectively. ",,,,
sms_beta_k_core,RESOURCE,"A modified beta core, stripped of most of its functions and fed with copious amounts of battle simulation data.

It's capable of putting its combat knowledge to great use, though it seems to prefer to defer to its commander where possible. As a result, knowledge cores benefit greatly when fielded by an equally competent commander.",,,,
sms_gamma_k_core,RESOURCE,"A modified gamma core, stripped of most of its functions and fed with copious amounts of battle simulation data.

It's capable of putting its combat knowledge to great use, though it seems to prefer to defer to its commander where possible. As a result, knowledge cores benefit greatly when fielded by an equally competent commander.",,,,
sms_fractured_gamma_core,RESOURCE,"A gamma core that's seen better days. No longer possesses the computing power required to assist in colony management, but a brazen -- or desperate -- commander with the right skillset may nonetheless utilize it to modestly enhance the combat effectiveness of one of their ships.
